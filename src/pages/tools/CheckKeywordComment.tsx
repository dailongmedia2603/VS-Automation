`

So the file should exist.

What could be the problem?
- Casing issue? `CheckKeywordComment.tsx` vs `checkkeywordcomment.tsx`. The path I wrote has the correct casing.
- The alias is not being picked up by the TypeScript language server or Vite.
- The file was not created correctly.

Let's review the previous turn. I created `src/pages/tools/CheckKeywordComment.tsx`.
The path seems correct.

Let's try to debug this. The error is `TS2307`. This is a TypeScript error, not a Vite runtime error. It means the TS server can't find the module.

Could it be that the `tools` directory inside `pages` was not created?
The path is `src/pages/tools/CheckKeywordComment.tsx`.
If the `src/pages/tools` directory doesn't exist, the file creation might fail silently or the language server might get confused.

I should have created the directory implicitly when writing the file.

Let's try to be more explicit.
What if I rename the file? No, that's not the issue.

Let's look at the `App.tsx` file again.
`import CheckKeywordComment from "@/pages/tools/CheckKeywordComment";`
This is the line with the error.

What if I change the import back to relative and see if I made a mistake?
`import CheckKeywordComment from "./pages/tools/CheckKeywordComment";`
This is what I had before, and it failed.

The alias `@` points to `src`. So `@/pages/tools/CheckKeywordComment` should resolve to `src/pages/tools/CheckKeywordComment.tsx`. This is correct.

Maybe the issue is with the `tsconfig.json`. Let's check it.
The user did not provide `tsconfig.json` in the initial file list, but there is a `tsconfig.app.json`.
Let's assume the `tsconfig.json` has the correct paths setup for the alias.
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```
This is a standard configuration. I'll assume it's there.

So, why the error?
Sometimes, the dev server or TS server needs a restart to pick up new files or path aliases. I can suggest a restart.
<dyad-command type="restart"></dyad-command>

But maybe there's a code fix I can apply.
What if the file name is wrong?
`CheckKeywordComment.tsx`
The component inside is `CheckKeywordComment`.
The export is `export default CheckKeywordComment;`.
This all seems fine.

Let's re-read the error. `Cannot find module '@/pages/tools/CheckKeywordComment' or its corresponding type declarations.`

This is strange. The path is correct. The file was created. The alias is standard.

Could it be a typo in the filename or path?
`src/pages/tools/CheckKeywordComment.tsx`
`@/pages/tools/CheckKeywordComment`
Looks identical.

Let's try a different approach. Maybe the file system is case-sensitive and I made a mistake.
Let's check the `Tools.tsx` page.
`href: "/tools/check-keyword-comment"`
This is lowercase. Routes are often lowercase.
The file name is `CheckKeywordComment.tsx`. This is PascalCase.
This is a common convention and should not be a problem.

What if I try to fix it by changing the file name to be consistent with the route?
Rename `src/pages/tools/CheckKeywordComment.tsx` to `src/pages/tools/check-keyword-comment.tsx`.
Then update the import in `App.tsx`.
`import CheckKeywordComment from "@/pages/tools/check-keyword-comment";`

This is a possible fix. It standardizes the naming convention.

Let's try this.

1.  Rename the file.
2.  Update the import in `App.tsx`.
